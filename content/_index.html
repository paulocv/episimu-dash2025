<h1>Your mission</h1>
<p>Within past 4 days 2 different hospitals in a small town (Smallville, Indiana) reported 
    23 people visiting emergency rooms complaining about fever, fatigue, coughing and 
    difficulty breathing. Two people have died soon after being hospitalized, several are 
    still at the hospital. Local Public Health Departments were called to investigate if 
    there is an outbreak and to put an end to it if it is an actual outbreak. The 
    notification was also sent to the CDC and the mayor of the town was notified.</p>

    <h2>Next steps:</h2>

    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
    <!-- Research possible options for these symptoms. -->

    <ul>
        <li>Do your research.</li>
        <li>Explore potential reasons for these symptoms.</li> 
        <li>Identify the level of emergency (if it is an outbreak) based on the severity and timing.</li> 
    </ul>
    Ask for additional information if needed. 

    <h4>Step 3:</h4>
    <!-- Establish the existence of an outbreak -->

    <ul>
        <li>Establish if these symptoms are caused by an infectious pathogen. Ask for more information if needed.</li>
        <li>Establish if these individuals are a part of an outbreak. If yes, what is the most likely route of transmission?</li> 
        <li>Identify if there is a potential for more people being infected. If yes, how much more?</li> 
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 4:</h4>
    <!-- Ask for the lab work that can confirm the diagnosis (identify causing agent). Make a list of what you want the lab personnel to look for. -->
    <ul>
        <li>Order lab tests. Define the sets of pathogens to test for. Some of the tests may take longer to process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 5:</h4> Construct working case definition
    <h4>Step 6:</h4> Decide whether contact tracing is necessary. Identify where and how to look for other potential cases if you suspect they exist.
    <h4>Step 7:</h4> Design information system that needs to be provided to you to make decisions (identify key information).
    <h4>Step 8:</h4> Analyze provided descriptive epidemiology.
    <h4>Step 9:</h4> Develop hypotheses.
    <h4>Step 10:</h4> Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically.
    <h4>Step 11:</h4> Reconcile epidemiology with lab and environmental findings.
    <h4>Step 12:</h4> Estimate key epidemiologic parameters.
    <h4>Step 13:</h4> Conduct additional studies if necessary.
    <h4>Step 14:</h4> Evaluate and design Control and prevention measures.
    <h4>Step 15:</h4> Initiate or maintain surveillance.
    <h4>Step 16:</h4> Evaluate the effectiveness of introduced measures.
    <h4>Step 17:</h4> Adjust measures and/or surveillance if needed.
    <h4>Step 18:</h4> Make conclusions for long-term control or other similar outbreaks.
