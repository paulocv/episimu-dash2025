<h2>Your mission</h2>
<p>Within the past weeks, multiple hospitals across Indiana reported 
    50 people being hospitalized with an unusual combination of symptoms for this period of time. 
    People complained about high fever, fatigue, coughing, diarhea, vomiting and headaches. 
    Five people have died soon after being hospitalized, several are 
    still at the hospital. Local Public Health Departments were called to investigate if 
    there is an outbreak and to put an end to it if it is. The 
    notification was also sent to the CDC and the governor was notified.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>

    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Do your research.</li>
        <li>Explore potential reasons for these symptoms.</li> 
        <li>Identify the level of emergency based on the severity and timing.</li>
        <li>Establish if these symptoms are caused by an infectious pathogen. Ask for more information if needed.</li>
        <li>Order lab tests. Define the sets of pathogens to test for. Some of the tests may take longer to process.</li>
    </ul>
    Ask for additional information if needed.

    <h4>Step 3:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If you establish that it is an outbreak, what is the most likely route of transmission?</li>
        <li>Identify if there is a potential for more people being infected. If yes, how much more?</li> 
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 4:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Construct working case definition</li>
        <li>Decide whether contact tracing is necessary. Identify where and how to look for other potential cases if you suspect they exist.</li>
        <li>Design information system that needs to be provided to you to make decisions (identify key information).</li>
        <li>Initiate or maintain surveillance.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Step 5:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze provided descriptive epidemiology.</li>
        <li>Develop hypotheses.</li>
        <li>Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically.</li>
        <li>Reconcile epidemiology with lab and environmental findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 6:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Estimate key epidemiologic parameters.</li>
        <li>Conduct additional studies if necessary.</li>
        <li>Evaluate and design additional control and/or prevention measures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 7:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of introduced measures.</li>
        <li>Adjust measures and/or surveillance if needed.</li>
        <li>Make conclusions for long-term control or other similar outbreaks.</li>
    </ul>
